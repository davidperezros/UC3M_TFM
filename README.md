Documents Containing my final master thesis

The aim of this repository is to host all the files related to my master thesis, Estimation of the Biological Age under a Bayesian Approach. If you have any trouble running it, please contact us at the following email address: [davidperez202223\@gmail.com](mailto:davidperez202223@gmail.com){.email}

# Structure

The repository is organized in different folders corresponding to the different simulations developed for the thesis. Let's give a brief description for each folder

-   \~\\ **Theoretical_Example**: It contains all the files related to the simulated theoretical example. A *.rmd* with the corresponding code of the desired data simulation and the posterior analysis of the biological age, a *.RData* file containing the output.
-   \~\\**Case Study**: It contains all files related to the main Case Study of the thesis. For privacy it doesn't contain the dataset used but just the code *rmd*, the output of the code and a folder containing the corresponding plots derived from the code which will be used for the thesis file.
